# Cookie Clicker Cheat

This is a script to execute clicks on your Cookie Clicker game. 
The script includes save and load functions.

This project it's just a selenium playing, don't take it too serious

Requirements:
  1) Install python if you don't have already installed
  2) Install selenium library with pip
  3) The script uses Firefox, so you need to download geckodriver and put it in the right directory, again, if you don't have it (https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
  4) Run cookie.py
  
To use the script just run it, and wait till it checks you save file. Once it's done, type the number of the clicks you want in your cookie or type 'exit' to close the browser and save the game (if you just close the browser without typing 'exit', the game won't be saved)
